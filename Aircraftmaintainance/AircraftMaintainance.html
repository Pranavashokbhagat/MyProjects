        <h3>Mechanical B1.1 / Avionics B2</h3>
        <h1>Aircraft Maintenance Engineering with B.Sc. Aeronautics</h1>
        <p>This unique combination of 3 years integrated program makes students eligible for multiple job opportunities
            including jobs which compulsory requires a minimum of three years degree as an eligibility criterion in
            Government as well as the private sector.
            Aircraft maintenance engineering courses can be pursued with our Institute which is approved by DGCA Govt.
            of India. The B.Sc. Aeronautics is affiliated to one of the top-notch Universities of Mumbai. B.Sc.
            Aeronautics degree is designed to enable the student to acquire the necessary qualification to enter into
            the job market in any field of Aviation such as Traffic Control, Crew & Manpower scheduling, In-Flight
            Service Department, Security, Civil Works Department, Line and Major Maintenance Department of Engineering
            etc. It is also possible that the graduates (B.Sc. Aeronautics) enter the field of Non- Technical Streams in
            the Aviation Industry like Commercial Dept., In-Flight Service Dept., Ground Support Dept., Security Dept.,
            etc. It is therefore imperative that such a degree course would help the students to make their career in
            Aviation. All government & private aviation organizations and aircraft & spacecraft manufacturing and
            testing units generally require the trained candidates.</p>
